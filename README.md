# UDACITY Data Scientist Nanodegree
Here is a brief description of the projects I have done.

2. Introduction to data science
- Write a Data Science blogpost:
  - I used a dataset of salaries of various undergraduate majors at the start of their career and at the mid points of the career to understand which major pays the best in the short term as well as the long term. I answered the following questions through exploratory data analysis
  1. What degrees/majors have the best starting salary?
  2. How does this change by mid-career?
  3. What is the spread like by mid-career? Which major has the lowest 10th percenting and highest 90th percentile?
- The medium blogpost about the same can be found here - https://rsharath2204.medium.com/what-major-pays-an-analysis-of-the-salaries-of-undergraduate-majors-in-na-9c88d08c5b30
